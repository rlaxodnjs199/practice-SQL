## 2. On the Canadian Border

:scroll: Problem

You are a border guard sitting on the Canadian border. You were given a list of travelers who have arrived at your gate today.

You only need to check the passports of citizens of all other countries!

Select names, and countries of origin of all the travelers, excluding anyone from Canada, Mexico, or The US.

:scroll: Problem

You received an invitation to an amazing party. Now you need to write an insert statement to add yourself to the table of participants.

participants table schema

```sql
INSERT INTO participants (name, age, attending) VALUES ('twkim', 31, true);

## 5. Countries Capitals for Trivia Night

:scroll: Problem

Your friends told you that if you keep coding on your computer, you are going to hurt your eyes. They suggested that you go with them to trivia night at the local club.

Once you arrive at the club, you realize the true motive behind your friends' invitation. They know that you are a computer nerd, and they want you to query the countries table and get the answers to the trivia questions.

Schema of the countries table:

country (String)
capital (String)
continent (String)
The first question: from the African countries that start with the character E, get the names of their capitals ordered alphabetically.

You should only give the names of the capitals. Any additional information is just noise
If you get more than 3, you will be kicked out, for being too smart
Also, this database is crowd-sourced, so sometimes Africa is written Africa and in other times Afrika.

:rocket: Solution
  
```sql
SELECT capital 
FROM countries 
WHERE continent IN ('Africa', 'Afrika') 
  AND country LIKE 'E%' 
ORDER BY capital
LIMIT 3;
```
