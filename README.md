## 5. Countries Capitals for Trivia Night

:scroll: Problem

Your friends told you that if you keep coding on your computer, you are going to hurt your eyes. They suggested that you go with them to trivia night at the local club.

Once you arrive at the club, you realize the true motive behind your friends' invitation. They know that you are a computer nerd, and they want you to query the countries table and get the answers to the trivia questions.

Schema of the countries table:

country (String)
capital (String)
continent (String)
The first question: from the African countries that start with the character E, get the names of their capitals ordered alphabetically.

You should only give the names of the capitals. Any additional information is just noise
If you get more than 3, you will be kicked out, for being too smart
Also, this database is crowd-sourced, so sometimes Africa is written Africa and in other times Afrika.

:rocket: Solution
  
```sql
SELECT capital 
FROM countries 
WHERE continent IN ('Africa', 'Afrika') 
  AND country LIKE 'E%' 
ORDER BY capital
LIMIT 3;
```

## 13. Calculating Running Total

:scroll: Problem
  
Description
Given a posts table that contains a created_at timestamp column write a query that returns date (without time component), a number of posts for a given date and a running (cumulative) total number of posts up until a given date. The resulting set should be ordered chronologically by date.

Desired Output
The resulting set should look similar to the following:

```
date       | count | total
-----------+-------+-------
2017-01-26 |    20 |    20
2017-01-27 |    17 |    37
2017-01-28 |     7 |    44
2017-01-29 |     8 |    52
...
```
date - (DATE) date
count - (INT) number of posts for a date
total - (INT) a running (cumulative) number of posts up until a date

:rocket: Solution
  
```sql
SELECT 
  created_at::date AS date, 
  count(*), 
  SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (ORDER BY created_at::date ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING)::int AS total
FROM posts
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY date;

## 14. Calculating Month-Over-Month Percentage Growth Rate

:scroll: Problem

Given a posts table that contains a created_at timestamp column write a query that returns a first date of the month, a number of posts created in a given month and a month-over-month growth rate.

The resulting set should be ordered chronologically by date.

Note:

percent growth rate can be negative
percent growth rate should be rounded to one digit after the decimal point and immediately followed by a percent symbol "%". See the desired output below for the reference.
Desired Output
The resulting set should look similar to the following:

```
date       | count | percent_growth
-----------+-------+---------------
2016-02-01 |   175 |           null
2016-03-01 |   338 |          93.1%
2016-04-01 |   345 |           2.1%
2016-05-01 |   295 |         -14.5%
2016-06-01 |   330 |          11.9%
...
```
date - (DATE) a first date of the month
count - (INT) a number of posts in a given month
percent_growth - (TEXT) a month-over-month growth rate expressed in percents
:rocket: Solution
  
```sql
WITH temp AS (
  SELECT
    to_char(created_at::date, 'YYYY-MM-01')::date AS date,
    COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM posts
  GROUP BY date
  ORDER BY date
)

SELECT 
  date,
  count,
  to_char((count - LAG(count) OVER ()) / LAG(count) OVER ()::float * 100, 'FM990.0%') AS percent_growth
FROM temp;

## 15. SQL Basics: Simple PIVOTING data WITHOUT CROSSTAB

:scroll: Problem

You need to build a pivot table WITHOUT using CROSSTAB function. Having two tables products and details you need to select a pivot table of products with counts of details occurrences (possible details values are ['good', 'ok', 'bad'].

Results should be ordered by product's name.

Model schema for the kata is:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26533193/125149005-e5198480-e0fb-11eb-860b-486f5c16fd5f.png)

schema

your query should return table with next columns

name
good
ok
bad
Compare your table to the expected table to view the expected results.

:rocket: Solution
  
```sql
SELECT
  p.name,
  count(CASE WHEN d.detail = 'good' THEN 1 END) AS good,
  count(CASE WHEN d.detail = 'ok' THEN 1 END) AS ok,
  count(CASE WHEN d.detail = 'bad' THEN 1 END) AS bad
FROM products p
INNER JOIN details d ON d.product_id = p.id
GROUP BY p.name
ORDER BY p.name;

## 17. Using Window Functions To Get Top N per Group

:scroll: Problem

Given the schema presented below write a query, which uses a window function, that returns two most viewed posts for every category.

Order the result set by:

category name alphabetically
number of post views largest to lowest
post id lowest to largest
Note:
Some categories may have less than two or no posts at all.
Two or more posts within the category can be tied by (have the same) the number of views. Use post id as a tie breaker - a post with a lower id gets a higher rank.
Schema
categories
```
 Column     | Type                        | Modifiers
------------+-----------------------------+----------

title       | character varying(255)      | not null
views       | integer                     | not null
```
Desired Output
The desired output should look like this:
```
category_id | category | title                             | views | post_id
------------+----------+-----------------------------------+-------+--------
5           | art      | Most viewed post about Art        | 9234  | 234

2           | business | NULL                              | NULL  | NULL
7           | sport    | Most viewed post about Sport      | 10    | 126
...
```
```
category_id - category id
category - category name
title - post title
views - the number of post views
post_id - post id
```
:rocket: Solution

## 18. SQL Basics: Simple table totaling

:scroll: Problem

For this challenge you need to create a simple query to display each unique clan with their total points and ranked by their total points.

people table schema
```
name
points
clan
```                  
You should then return a table that resembles below

select on
```
rank
clan
total_points
total_people
```
The query must rank each clan by their total_points, you must return each unqiue clan and if there is no clan name (i.e. it is an empty string) you must replace it with [no clan specified], you must sum the total_points for each clan and the total_people within that clan.

##Note The data is loaded from the live leaderboard, this means values will change but also could cause the kata to time out retreiving the information.

:rocket: Solution

```sql
SELECT
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(points) DESC),
  COALESCE(NULLIF(clan, ''), '[no clan specified]') AS clan,
  SUM(points) AS total_points,
  COUNT(*) AS total_people
FROM people
GROUP BY clan
ORDER BY total_points DESC;

## 19. SQL Basics: Simple WITH

:scroll: Problem

For this challenge you need to create a SELECT statement, this SELECT statement will use an IN to check whether a department has had a sale with a price over 90.00 dollars BUT the sql MUST use the WITH statement which will be used to select all columns from sales where the price is greater than 90.00, you must call this sub-query special_sales.

departments table schema
```
id

## 20. SQL Basics: Simple NULL handling

:scroll: Problem

For this challenge you need to create a SELECT statement, this select statement must have NULL handling, using COALESCE and NULLIF.

If no name is specified you must replace with [product name not found]

If no card_name is specified you must replace with [card name not found]

If no price is specified you must throw away the record, you must also filter the dataset by prices greater than 50.

eusales table schema

card_name
card_number
transaction_date
```
resultant table schema
```
id
